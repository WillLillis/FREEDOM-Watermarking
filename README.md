# FREEDOM Watermarking

This repo will hold some quick and dirty code/scripts used to investigate RF watermarking as part of the ARL FREEDOM project

The datasets for this are a bit unwieldy, so instead of packing them into this repo, I've instead included a shell script to download it into the appropriate sub directory for the code.

Currently, sample.py reads in the data, displays it in real/complex form, and then performs an FFT and displays that as well. 

Actual watermarking work soon...
